## Usage 
The plugin allows users to build and manage houses using the following commands:
- `/build <width> [<length> <height>]`

- `/destroy <houseID>`
Removes the house with the chosen **houseID** and deletes it from the list of houses.

- `/listhouses`
Lists all existing houses.

## Installation
To install the plugin simply download the **buildHouse.jar** file from this repository and copy it into the **plugins** folder of your **Craft-Bukkit** server. If you need help setting up a **Craft-Bukkit** server, please visit [this](https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Setting_up_a_server) page.
